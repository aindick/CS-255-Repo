- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  
  The client is DriverPass. They wanted an online driving test and driving lesson system for students who need help passing their driver's test.

- What did you do particularly well?
  
  I think I did a good job listing out each functional and non-functional requirement for the system. Overall, I believe my business requirements document I did the best because of the functional and non-functional requirements. 

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  
  I think I would improve my class diagram and my sequence diagram. For my class diagram, I'd add more methods that are relevant to the DriverPass's design. For my sequence diagram, I would try to make the flow more consistent since I felt it didn't make a lot of sense.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  
  I interpretted the user's needs through reading the exchange between the developers and DriverPass. I also put myself in the user's shoes and though about things I'd like to see if I was a user. It is important to consider the user's needs because they will be the ones to use it. If the platform is not to their liking, they will not use it. 

- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  
  I approach designing software by getting the requirements, functional and non-functional, then make diagrams such as a class, sequence, activity, etc. I then put myself in the shoes of the user and think about the things they'd probably like to see in the software. I can then put all of these into a business requirements document to keep everything clear and concise. The stategy of making a business requirement document and making diagrams I believe I will use in the future definitely since it helped me clear my thoughts. The system design document too I will incorperate into my future designs since I was able to view all my diagrams in one document.
